# 月の物語 - Tsuki No Monogatari
## Tale of the Moon 
## Jhas

## I - Meiseki
The white-haired girl, slashed by the satanic being on the face, falls onto the gravel, dazed. Her sword flies through the air and lands on a pool of pebbles.

Clank.

The sudden metallic sound brings me back from my trance. My eyes linger at the slowly regenerating beast then back at the fallen girl.

She’s injured.

Her blood… the scent alone makes me bloodthirsty…

Bewildered, I take a few paces towards her.

She’s a marechi! 

I begin to lose myself, demon instinct controlling me this time.

Marechi…

🌙

No.

I was once a demon slayer.

I will always be one.

I will protect humans.

Giving one last glance back at the white-haired girl, I take my battle stance at the hideous beast before me.

## II - Aika

Hah- Hah- 

Aika, wake up!

Hah- Hah-

Wake UP!

I force my eyes to open. Before me stood the most peculiar scene. A person appeared out of nowhere and took my place in the fight.

Who is he?

Help him!

So many thoughts run through my head, but my incompetant body cannot move any more from the beast’s slash. 

Will he be able to fight it off alone?

🌙

My question has been answered.

He holds up his blade, which I notice is a striking blue, and alters his stance, shifting weight onto both legs.

I can feel the pressure coming from him, but there is something off. 

His body is giving off a demonic aura.

Are my senses working?

From the side, his striking features are determined, no blood lust, no signs of weakness either.

Despite that, I watch in awe as he delivers his blows. 

**Breath of Blood: Third form**

**Overarching Blood Moon**

In two blade slashes, blinding red light illuminated the entire mountain.

I had not even seen his movement, but the demon’s head was cut clean off. 


☀  ☀  ☀

## III - Meiseki

I stand, as if frozen.

My blade falls to the ground, my fingers no longer gripping the hilt.

As the creature melts and crumbles into nothingness, I stare blankly into the slowly disintegrating cells of the very monster I loath, who tore Akiko into pieces, bit by bit, who devoured the people of Vaedisu without a moment’s hesitation. I cannot help but feel a sliver of satisfaction.

🌙

I have done it, accomplished a feat no one has ever done, travelled onto unknown land where no man has ever stepped foot on.

Even though I am a demon.

Even though that man’s blood still runs through me, flooding through my veins, my hands, every inch of my body.

It’s telling me to do something.

Get.

That.

Girl.

I suppress the strong urge to tear her up, falling to the ground. 

When would we ever be free?

☀  ☀  ☀

## IV - Aika

Did… Did he really… slice its head off?

I watch him collapse to the ground, and I rush over.

He looks like he has his stamina drained, but the closer I get to him, the weaker he looks. What does that mean?

His complexion is pale like the shining moon high in the sky, yet there is no radiance in his skin. 

Please, please don’t let him die…

My pleas are drowned by a shrill sound that resembles that of a screeching crow.

At this point, my mind is already swimming through clouds, my eyelids heavy like lead.

Shibuya is here, finally.

I can’t stay awake anymo-

☀  ☀  ☀

## V - Meiseki

Where am I?

I -  the girl - headache - my sword - 

They all come crashing towards me.

I look around. 

I am lying on a bed, with a tray of food - a slice of fruit cake, some berries, and a bottle of ramune - on the table beside me. The girl I just met is asleep, resting her head on the bed next to my hand, the wound on her face cleaned and no longer bloody. It is clear that she has stayed with me after I passed out.

My blade is deposited near the window of the small room I was in, next to her white, shimmering one.

🌙

Has she found out that I am a demon?

A slight shiver goes through me.

I have spent so much effort blending into human society. I don’t want to be a demon!

It’s all because of that man. 

He transformed me into this when I was weakest, but I will never fight for him.

Regardless of what he does.

☀  ☀  ☀

## VI - Aika

This person… He’s definitely unusual. His quick reflexes, his unique aura, his healing speed, they all signal to me that he is a demon.

But why, why then, would he protect me and slay those of his kind?

And why does he use a breath?

I stare at his lean figure before unknowingly falling asleep.

I dream of a blue sky and clouds, and a world where no demons roam the landscapes, a world with no chaos and no wars.

🌙

My dream turns into a nightmare…

Kibutsuji…The mysterious man… coming for me, smiling sadistically…

Drenched in sweat, I jerk awake to find myself back in the room, right beside the good demon.

“AHH” I scream as I realise I had been clinging to his arm the whole time as I slept.

☀  ☀  ☀

## VII - Meiseki
Not long ago, the girl started clinging onto my hand. She is perspiring a lot, probably having a nightmare of some sort…

She suddenly wakes, tossing her long, silvery hair back, looking alarmed.

Then comes an ear-splitting scream. She lets go of my hand, all red-faced, and hops off out of the room.

I stare at her disappearing, swishing silver hair, dumbfounded.

I can feel a special presence with this girl, the way she walks, the way she slashes, it all reminds me of something… or someone.

🌙

The girl inches in, carrying a tray of fruits after seeing I finished the food. I notice she keeps her gaze down.

“Here’s - Here’s some fruits,” 

“Oh, thanks.”

“and... th - thank you for just now!” 

She sets down the tray and runs out blushing.

She’s got a completely different personality in battle and now, man.

Now she’s really shy, and blushes and all that, maybe even a little cute.

☀  ☀  ☀

## VIII - Aika

Did he smile at me?

AHHHH!

I don’t know what is wrong with me.

I should focus on only slaying demons, but he - he has a gravity of some sort… I just can’t resist looking at him…

But he's a demon, and I-

I force myself to dispose of this shameful thought. I am a demon slayer, and I will never stop unless Kibutsuji falls.

🌙

I insist that Meiseki lives in Moon Residence for now, as he does not seem to have recovered from the battle.

Oddly enough, Meiseki is still persistent on fasting. On the fourth day of starving himself, he comes up behind me, all red-faced.

"What is wrong?" Concerned, I stare up into his eyes.

"I- Uh- It's nothing!"

He has been acting weird for the past few days, does he have hunger for blood too? He seems like a demon anyways...

Am I in danger?

## IX (I) - Meiseki

I sense a demon right here, in Moon Residence.

But there is no one here except Aika-

And she doesn’t seem to believe there is a demon here, either. 

Should I trust my demon senses?

🌙

Aika just went out to get some flowers for decoration.

Now, I can feel the demon, the aura of it was stronger than the previous one Aika had encountered.

This demon had eaten at least… 

Two hundred people?!

That makes it a lower moon!

I feel myself tense involuntarily. Why would a member of the Twelve Kizuki come _here_ to hunt Aika down?

🌙

I pick up my blade and start towards where I feel the demonic presence is.

It seems to be in the back garden of Moon Residence. Looking around, I realise my hand gripping my nichirin blade is shaking. This place gives me a strange feeling, but it does not matter now. Aika does not need any more trouble.


I stare at the word carved onto the blade.


滅

Destroy.


In battle, I always need to take that extra care not to slash myself in any way, as it always has the same effect on me as the demon I am facing.

Otherwise, I would be destroyed by my own breath.

That man… I will never forgive him… 

🌙

Enough hesitation.

I pick up the blade with my two snagged wrists, and stabbed it straight into whatever was infront of me.

Ha.

That will be the end of me...
